      <p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Terms Of Services</p>
     
      Crypto CVD Art s is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to buy and sell unique and funny rare stickers (based on Health, Medicine, Virology, Medical, Virrus, etc), which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the “Site”). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App”. Using the App, users can view their stickers and use the Smart Contracts to acquire and trade with other App users via clock auction.
      
      <br/><br/>
      
      PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS.

      <p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>1- Crypto CVD Art</p>
     
      Crypto CVD Art is a marketplace of unique and rare stickers all over the world. Born from the idea of ​​the Coronovirus pandemic, it wants to bring more unique than rare collectibles in your homes.
Nice collectibles with different types of rarity will be the result of a fantastic and accurate selection model.
Based on the Etherum blockchain, it allows you to buy and resell nice art elements using a double currency: ETH and CVD.
The platform is born as an evolution of the ERC 20 Token called Covid19 - CVD, with the aim of entertaining users during the pandemic period and also subsequently.
      <br/>
      <br/>  

      <p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>2- Covid 19 - CVD</p>
      COVID19 TOKEN (CVD) is an ERC 20 Token as a contract into the Etherum Blockchain.<br/>
        <br/>

       Coin Name : Covid19<br/>
Ticker : CVD<br/>
Standard : ERC20<br/>
Blockchain: Etherum<br/>
Total Supply : 20.000.000.000<br/>
Decimals: 0<br/>

<br/>


<p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>3- The App</p>
     
A. To most easily use the App, you may first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser) and an electronic wallet compatible with the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard on the Ethereum network, such as the MetaMask electronic wallet. MetaMask and other electronic wallets allow you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third party sites), store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask, or other Ethereum-compatible browsers.
<br/>
<br/>
B. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
<br/>
<br/>
C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with any such third parties.
<br/>
<br/>
D. You are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts). If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at postmaster@cryptocvdart.org
<br/>
<br/>

<p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>4- CVD and Crypto CVD Art</p>
     
CVD is therefore an ERC 20 Token whose purpose is to encourage purchases on the CVD art Marketplace. Users will then be able to purchase or resell collectibles using the dual ETH / CVD currency. All those who will be able to use CVD rather than ETH will receive special discounts and prizes compared to other users.
"For example, the limited collection will be one of those things reserved only for users who have reached a certain CVD quorum"
      <br/>
      <br/>  

      <p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>5- Crypto CVD Art Stickers</p>
     
      There are three types of collectible sticker items: Normal, Rare, Legendary. Each of these three types will have a different percentage of rarity.
      <br/><br/>
      - Normal: there may be 10 to 30 stickers <br/><br/>
- Rare: there may be 4 to 9 stickers <br/><br/>
- Legendary: there may be 1 to 3 stickers <br/><br/>

Each sticker will have an initial price based on its rarity.The first time a sticker is offered for sale, users will only be able to decide whether to buy it or not.

they will have two purchase options: CVD and ETH. Those who buy in CVD will not only have a discount on the initial price, but will take advantage of special access dedicated to premium users (For example a limited sticker collection).

After a user has made the purchase of a Sticker, he will become the owner and will be able to resell it at the price he deems most appropriate.

            <br/>
            <br/> 
            <p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>6- Fees and Payment</p>
            A. If you elect to purchase or trade on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or independently using the Smart Contracts.     
            <br/>
            <br/>  
            B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that, even if you elect to interact directly via the Ethereum network without using the App as a portal, you will still need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Ethereum network.
            <br/>
            <br/>  
            C. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 4% of the total value of that transaction (each, a “Commission”). You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment. We will not collect a Commission for interactions that do not involve our App marketplace.
            <br/>
            <br/> 
            D. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership and transfer of any of your Stickers). Except for income taxes levied on Crypto Cvd Art, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.

            <p style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>6- Ownership</p>
     
           A.

            <br/><br/>
